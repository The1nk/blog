# Would You Use That in an Interview?

At the office our team received an interesting challenge via email, seen below:

>Ok SQL folks here is a test (participation is optional) murder mystery SQL style!! The first response with the right answer(s) wins. Least amount of select statements possible.  Winner gets lunch on me , bonus if another person is slower but has less queries for the final answer(s) I am buying two lunches. Obviously don’t do the walkthrough and don’t reply all.   I want either screen prints or your solutions.
>Good Luck!!
